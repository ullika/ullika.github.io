<h3>Hello and welcome to my website!</h3> <br>
Currently I am a Ph.D. student at RWTH Aachen University. Slides from Talks and
Links to Journal Arcticles can be found on my 
  <a href="https://www.acom.rwth-aachen.de/the-lab/team-people/name:ullika_scholz"></a>university website</a>.
If you are interested in a light-hearted introduction to my research subject, check out the 
  <a href="doc_root/lightning-talk.html">talk I gave at RWTH's "Dr. rer .mat. night</a> in 2023.
In the past years I have completed several fun and (sometimes) useful <a href="doc_root/projects.html>">pet projects</a>
If you wonder how I look like or what I do in my free time you can look at some pictures <a href="doc_root/pictures.html"> here </a>.
