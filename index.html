<h3>Ullika Scholz</h3>
Hello and Welcome! Currently I am a Ph.D. student at RWTH Aachen University in Germany. For slides from research talks and
and journal arcticles I refer to my
  <a href="https://www.acom.rwth-aachen.de/the-lab/team-people/name:ullika_scholz">university website</a>.
  <br>
If you are interested in a light-hearted introduction to my research subject, check out the 
  <a href="doc_root/lightning-talk.html">talk</a> I gave at RWTH's "Dr. rer. mat. night" in 2023.
  <br>
In the past years I have completed several fun and (sometimes) useful <a href="doc_root/projects.html">pet projects</a>.
  <br>
For job offers, requests or in case you just want to say hi, please send an email. The address is simply my first name
at the provider mailbox.org.<br>
